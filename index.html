            <h3>Method Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>For this recipe, the cassava must already be cooked and mashed. Do this in advance, it can be the day before.</li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho02.webp" alt="first layer of the cassava">
                <li>Now let's prepare the chicken stuffing. Separate the ingredients (the chicken must also be cooked and shredded).</li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho03.webp" alt="chicken ingredients">
                <li>Place a pan over medium heat and fry the garlic in the oil. Then add the onion.</li>
                <li>Add the paprika and mix well. <br><i>Tip: paprika is also known as annatto and is a spice that will leave the chicken filling with an even more irresistible color and aroma! If not, you can substitute sweet or smoked paprika.</i></li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho04.webp" alt="papikra">
                <li>Add the shredded chicken, cumin, and chopped tomato. Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste. Book this chicken stuffing</li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho05.webp">
                
                <li>Grease the refractory that will be used to take the escondidinho to the oven with olive oil. <br><i>Tip: you can prepare this chicken escondidinho in a large refractory or in smaller refractories, for individual portions, as I did.</i></li>
                <li>Place a layer of the mashed cassava and a layer of the braised chicken that we prepared earlier.</li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho06.webp">
                <li>Then put a layer of curd and another layer of mashed cassava.</li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho07.webp">
                <li>Finish with diced mozzarella cheese and bake in a preheated oven at 200 degrees just until the cheese melts and is golden. <br></ve><i>Tip: if you are preparing this recipe for escondidinho to freeze, wrap the refractory with plastic wrap after adding the mozzarella cheese, and set it aside for up to 3 months. Bake in the oven just before serving.</i></li>
                <img src="images/escondidinho08.webp">
                <li>Your delicious chicken escondidinho with cassava and cottage cheese is ready!</li>

            <h3>Method Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>“Bloom” the yeast by sprinkling the sugar and yeast in the warm water. Let sit for 10 minutes, until bubbles form on the surface.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the middle and add the olive oil and bloomed yeast mixture. Using a spoon, mix until a shaggy dough begins to form.</li>
                <li>Once the flour is mostly hydrated, turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead for 10-15 minutes. The dough should be soft, smooth, and bouncy. Form the dough into a taut round.</li>
                <li>Grease a clean, large bowl with olive oil and place the dough inside, turning to coat with the oil. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for at least an hour, or up to 24 hours.</li>
                <img src="images/pizza1.webp">
                <li>Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface. Knead for another minute or so, then cut into 4 equal portions and shape into rounds.</li>
                <img src="images/pizza1.2.webp">
                <li>Lightly flour the dough, then cover with a kitchen towel and let rest for another 30 minutes to an hour while you prepare the sauce and any other ingredients.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven as high as your oven will allow, between 450-500˚F (230-260˚C). Place a pizza stone, heavy baking sheet (turn upside down so the surface is flat), or cast iron skillet in the oven.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce: Add the salt to the can of tomatoes and puree with an immersion blender, or transfer to a blender or food processor, and puree until smooth.</li>
                <li>Once the dough has rested, take a portion and start by poking the surface with your fingertips, until bubbles form and do not deflate.</li>
                <li>Then, stretch and press the dough into a thin round. Make it thinner than you think it should be, as it will slightly shrink and puff up during baking.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle semolina onto an upside down baking sheet and place the stretched crust onto it. Add the sauce and ingredients of your choice.</li>
                <li>Slide the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone or pan. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust and cheese are golden brown.</li>
                <li>Add any garnish of your preference.</li>

        <section>
            <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <p>Hi Cara, this recipe can be cooked on the barbecue, on a griddle pan or a frying pan. Just make sure that the mince is cooked all the way through before serving.</p>
            <p>You can freeze the burgers. We recommend freezing the patties raw, once they're shaped then defrost the burgers fully before cooking.</p>
            <p><q>I added celery salt (level teaspoon) and half a teaspoon of ground white pepper.</q></p>
